## Unity 
> Game Engine written in C#
Unity is a software whose primary goal is to work as a Game Development engine but it supports Web3, Mixed Reality, Metaverse Building, Player Data Analytics and what not in the current workspace. On comparison to its competitor Unreal Engine 5, it is way easier to learn and helps the user to build his skills from scratch as it provides minimal boilerplates.

If you are aware of any programming language, then learning C# for unity is not a big deal. Try to skim through to the main parts. But if you are a first timer, try to pay a bit more attention. If so you would not face any difficulty in the future.

Hooray!! If you have completed the above links, you are good to develop your own video games.
### It is highly adviced to develop couple of games on your own using the above concepts. Try making changes to the existing ones or build your own game from scratch before jumping onto other tutorials. 

The following are referral links to go through if needed.
